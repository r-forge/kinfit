gmkin repository
================

This repository was created as the gWidgetsWWW2 package whose development
is taking place at http://github.com/jverzani/gWidgetsWWW2 does not currently
comply to CRAN policies. The difficulties are (citing gWidgetsWWW2 author John
Verzani, issue 10 on github, Nov 2013):

- the extjs files are too big
- the path names are too long
- the use of attach is needed but problematic
- the assignment within .GlobalEnv is frowned upon

The size of the extjs files in the gWidgetsWWW2 package has meanwhile been
reduced by excluding files that are not used by the package. The long path names
appear not to be problematic in practice. The package attaches an R object "app" 
in the global workspace which should not be saved and restored across sessions.

The repository contains source packages under src/contrib and Windows binaries
under bin/windows/contrib, so its URL can be specified as an additional
repository in R (see gmkin installation instructions).
