#' Function to perform isometric log-ratio transformation
#' 
#' This implementation is a special case of the class of isometric log-ratio
#' transformations.
#' 
#' @aliases ilr invilr
#' @param x A numeric vector. Naturally, the forward transformation is only
#'   sensible for vectors with all elements being greater than zero.
#' @return The result of the forward or backward transformation. The returned
#'   components always sum to 1 for the case of the inverse log-ratio
#'   transformation.
#' @author Ren√© Lehmann and Johannes Ranke
#' @seealso Another implementation can be found in R package
#'   \code{robCompositions}.
