\title{
  Function to set up a kinetic submodel for one state variable
}
\description{
  This is a convenience function to set up the lists used as arguments for 
  \code{\link{mkinmod}}.
}
\usage{
mkinsub(submodel, to = NULL, sink = TRUE, full_name = NA)
}
\arguments{
  \item{submodel}{
    Character vector of length one to specify the submodel type. See 
    \code{\link{mkinmod}} for the list of allowed submodel names.
  }
  \item{to}{
    Vector of the names of the state variable to which a transformation 
    shall be included in the model.
  }
  \item{sink}{
    Should a pathway to sink be included in the model in addition to the 
    pathways to other state variables?
  }
  \item{full_name}{
    An optional name to be used e.g. for plotting fits performed with the model.
    You can use non-ASCII characters here, but then your R code will not be
    portable, \emph{i.e.} may produce unintended plot results on other
    operating systems or system configurations.
  }
}
\value{
  A list for use with \code{\link{mkinmod}}.
