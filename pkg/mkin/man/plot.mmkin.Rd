\title{
  Plot model fits (observed and fitted) and the residuals for a row or column of an mmkin object
}
\description{
  When x is a row selected from an mmkin object (\code{\link{[.mmkin}}), the same model
  fitted for at least one dataset is shown. When it is a column, the fit of at least one model
  to the same dataset is shown.
}
\usage{
\method{plot}{mmkin}(x, main = "auto", legends = 1, errmin_var = "All data", errmin_digits = 3,
              cex = 0.7, rel.height.middle = 0.9, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
    An object of class \code{\link{mmkin}}, with either one row or one column.
}
  \item{main}{
    The main title placed on the outer margin of the plot.
}
  \item{legends}{
    An index for the fits for which legends should be shown.
}
  \item{errmin_var}{
    The variable for which the FOCUS chi2 error value should be shown.
}
  \item{errmin_digits}{
    The number of significant digits for rounding the FOCUS chi2 error percentage.
}
  \item{cex}{
    Passed to the plot functions and \code{\link{mtext}}.
}
  \item{rel.height.middle}{
    The relative height of the middle plot, if more than two rows of plots are shown.
}
  \item{\dots}{
    Further arguments passed to \code{\link{plot.mkinfit}} and \code{\link{mkinresplot}}.
}
}
\value{
  The function is called for its side effect.

\examples{
  # Only use one core not to offend CRAN checks, use Levenberg-Marquardt for speed
  fits <- mmkin(c("FOMC", "HS"), 
                list("FOCUS B" = FOCUS_2006_B, "FOCUS C" = FOCUS_2006_C), # named list for titles
                cores = 1, quiet = TRUE, method.modFit = "Marq")
  plot(fits[, "FOCUS C"])
  plot(fits["FOMC", ])

  # We can also plot a single fit, if we like the way plot.mmkin works, but then the plot
  # height should be smaller than the plot width (this is not possible for the html pages
  # generated by pkgdown, as far as I know).
  plot(fits["FOMC", "FOCUS C"]) # same as plot(fits[1, 2])
}
