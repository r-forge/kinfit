\title{ Single First-Order Reversible Binding kinetics }
\description{
  Function describing the solution of the differential equations describing
  the kinetic model with first-order terms for a two-way transfer from a free
  to a bound fraction, and a first-order degradation term for the free
  fraction.  The initial condition is a defined amount in the free fraction and
  no substance in the bound fraction.
}
\usage{
  SFORB.solution(t, parent.0, k_12, k_21, k_1output)
}
\arguments{
  \item{t}{ Time. }
  \item{parent.0}{ Starting value for the response variable at time zero. }
  \item{k_12}{ Kinetic constant describing transfer from free to bound. }
  \item{k_21}{ Kinetic constant describing transfer from bound to free. }
  \item{k_1output}{ Kinetic constant describing degradation of the free fraction. }
}
\value{
  The value of the response variable, which is the sum of free and bound 
  fractions at time \code{t}.
