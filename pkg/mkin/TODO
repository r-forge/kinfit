- Fix SFORB coefficient matrix by treating SFORB models with metabolites with ilr as well
- Calculate confidence intervals for parameters assuming normal distribution
- Calculate confidence intervals for DT50 and DT90 values when only one parameter is involved
- Fix DT50 and DT90 calculation for SFORB_SFO
- Add unit tests for mkinfit
- Document validation against fits documented in chapter 13 of FOCUS (2006)
- Reproduce example anaylses (L1, L2, ...) in FOCUS (2006)
- Generate confidence intervals for DT50 and DT90 values for other cases
