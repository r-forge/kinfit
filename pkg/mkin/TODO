Nice to have:
- Get starting values for formation fractions from data
- Calculate confidence intervals for more than one formation fraction using Monte Carlo simulations
- Calculate confidence intervals for DT50 and DT90 values when only one
  parameter is involved
- Calculate transformation only DT50 values (exclude pathways to sink) as
  additional information
