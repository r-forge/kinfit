Description: 'kinfit' provides simple calculation routines based on the FOCUS
 Kinetics Report (2006). Only kinetic models for parent only datasets are 
 included (no metabolite formation/decline or multicompartment kinetics).
 Please note that no warranty is implied for correctness of results or
 fitness for a particular purpose.
 This package is maintained, but not actively developed at the moment. Please
 check the mkin package for an actively developed package for kinetic
 evaluations of degradation data.
