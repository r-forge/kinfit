Title: Routines for fitting kinetic models to chemical degradation data
Version: 1.1.13
Date: 2014-11-24
Author: Johannes Ranke, with contributions from Katrin Lindenberger
Maintainer: Johannes Ranke <jranke@uni-bremen.de>
Description: Simple calculation routines based on the FOCUS Kinetics 
 Report (2006). Only kinetic models for parent only datasets are 
 included (no metabolite formation/decline or multicompartment kinetics).
 Please note that no warranty is implied for correctness of results or
 fitness for a particular purpose.
 This package is not actively developed at the moment. Please check the mkin
 package for an actively maintained package for kinetic evaluations of
 degradation data
